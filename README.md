# Hadoop-MapReduce

1. Dataset is of directed graph and the data location is on the cluster /data/graph.
2. The location of the Sample Data : data/graph/sample.txt. There might be noise in the dataset.
   Ignore the line in the data file starting with #.
3. Convert the Directed graph to directed graph.
4. Create adjacency list for both directed graph and undirected graph.
5. Find the longest adjacency list in directed and undirected graph and also the node with maximum and minimum connectivity.
